["Title: Understanding Vector Search and RAG Systems \n1. FAISS Overview \nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library designed for efficient similarity search \nand clustering of dense vectors. \nIt is commonly used to perform nearest neighbor search on high-dimensional \nembeddings. \nFAISS is widely adopted in retrieval-augmented generation systems to store and search \nvector embeddings generated by models such as SBERT. \n \n2. Sentence Embeddings \nSentence-BERT (SBERT) is a model that generates dense vector representations for \nsentences. \nThese embeddings capture semantic meaning and are often used with vector \ndatabases such as FAISS. \nSBERT embeddings are typically compared using cosine similarity or Euclidean \ndistance. \n \n3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) \nRetrieval-Augmented Generation combines information retrieval with text generation. \nInstead of relying solely on a language model\u2019s internal knowledge, RAG systems \nretrieve relevant documents and use them as evidence for generating answers. \nRAG systems help reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved content. \n \n4. Contradictory Statement (for testing) \nFAISS is not suitable for similarity search and does not work with vector embeddings. \n(This statement is intentionally incorrect and is included to test contradiction \ndetection.) \n \n5. Summary \nFAISS, SBERT, and RAG systems together enable scalable, accurate, and explainable AI \napplications.", "By combining retrieval and generation, modern AI systems can provide more \ntrustworthy responses."]
